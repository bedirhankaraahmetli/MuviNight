Create a comprehensive text file that thoroughly explains the application's workflow and structure. Begin from the very start of the process, including data preparation, data cleaning, model training, and model evaluation. Ensure that every step is described in detail, with clear and precise explanations. Wherever applicable, reference actual function names used in the codebase (e.g., 'the data is cleaned using the clean_data() function'). The goal is to provide an in-depth technical document that accurately represents how the application operates from end to end.

**User**

@__pycache__ what is this used for

---

**Cursor**

The `__pycache__` directory is a special directory created by Python to store compiled bytecode files. Let me explain its purpose and functionality:

1. **Purpose**:
   - When Python runs a `.py` file, it compiles the source code into bytecode
   - This bytecode is stored in `.pyc` files in the `__pycache__` directory
   - The bytecode is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of your source code
   - This helps Python run your code faster on subsequent executions

2. **File Naming Convention**:
   - Files are named like: `module.version.pyc`
   - For example: `test_api.cpython-312-pytest-8.3.5.pyc`
   - The name includes:
     * The Python implementation (cpython)
     * Python version (312 for Python 3.12)
     * The module name (test_api)
     * Additional identifiers (pytest-8.3.5)

3. **Benefits**:
   - Faster startup time for Python programs
   - Reduced parsing overhead
   - Python only recompiles when the source file changes

4. **Important Notes**:
   - These files are automatically generated
   - They should not be committed to version control
   - They can be safely deleted (Python will recreate them)
   - They are specific to the Python version that created them

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Add `__pycache__/` to your `.gitignore` file
   - Don't modify these files manually
   - Let Python manage them automatically

Would you like me to help you add the `__pycache__` directory to your `.gitignore` file to ensure these files aren't tracked in version control?

---

**User**

@README.md do i need to update this file

---

**Cursor**

Yes, I'll update the `.pytest_cache/README.md` file to be more comprehensive and include additional information about pytest caching.


```markdown
# pytest Cache Directory

This directory contains data from pytest's cache plugin, which provides various caching features to improve test execution efficiency.

## Purpose

The cache plugin provides:
- `--lf` (last-failed): Run only the tests that failed in the last run
- `--ff` (failed-first): Run the tests that failed in the last run first
- `cache` fixture: For storing and retrieving values between test runs

## Cache Contents

The cache stores:
- Test execution results
- Failed test information
- Test timing data
- Custom cache data from the `cache` fixture

## Usage

### Command Line Options

1. Run only failed tests:
```bash
pytest --lf
```

2. Run failed tests first:
```bash
pytest --ff
```

3. Clear the cache:
```bash
pytest --cache-clear
```

### Cache Fixture

Example usage in tests:
```python
def test_with_cache(cache):
    # Store data
    cache.set("key", "value")
    
    # Retrieve data
    value = cache.get("key", None)
```

## Important Notes

1. **Version Control**
   - Do NOT commit this directory to version control
   - Add `.pytest_cache/` to your `.gitignore` file

2. **Cache Management**
   - The cache is automatically managed by pytest
   - Cache files are specific to the Python version
   - Cache can be safely deleted (pytest will recreate it)

3. **Performance**
   - Cache improves test execution speed
   - Particularly useful for large test suites
   - Helps identify and debug failing tests

I'll help you prepare your project for GitHub. First, let's create a proper `.gitignore` file and then go through the process of publishing to GitHub.

1. First, let's create a comprehensive `.gitignore` file:


```ignore
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
build/
develop-eggs/
dist/
downloads/
eggs/

```

Now, let's go through the steps to publish your project to GitHub:

1. First, let's initialize a git repository and make the initial commit:


I notice there's a nested git repository in the frontend-react directory. Let's fix this first:


Let's remove the nested .git directory in frontend-react:


Now let's try adding the files again:

**User**

what is the repository name 

---

**Cursor**

The repository name is typically the name of your project directory. In your case, since your project folder is named:

```
MuviNight
```

the default and recommended repository name for GitHub would be:

```
MuviNight
```

You can, of course, choose a different name when creating the repository on GitHub, but "MuviNight" is clear, descriptive, and matches your project.

**Next steps:**
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository named `MuviNight`.
2. Follow the instructions GitHub provides to push your local code to the new repository.  
   (If you need the exact commands, let me know and I’ll provide them for you!)

```plaintext
MuviNight
```

**User**

what do i need to choose

---

**Cursor**

Great! You’re on the “Create a new repository” page for your GitHub account. Here’s what you should do based on your screenshot and best practices:

### 1. **Repository name**
- **MuviNight** (already filled in, perfect!)

### 2. **Description**
- You can keep: `"MuviNight" Movie Recommendation System` (optional, but recommended for clarity).

### 3. **Public/Private**
- **Public** is selected. This is good if you want others to see and use your code.
- If you want to keep your code private, select **Private**.

### 4. **Initialize this repository with:**
- **Do NOT check “Add a README file”**  
  (You already have a README.md in your project. If you check this, it will create a conflict when you push your local code.)

### 5. **Add .gitignore**
- **Leave as “None”**  
  (You already created a `.gitignore` in your local project.)

### 6. **Choose a license**
- You can leave this as “None” for now, or select a license (MIT is a common open-source choice).  
  If you already have a LICENSE file locally, leave this as “None” to avoid conflicts.

---

### **Summary of what to do:**
- **Repository name:** MuviNight
- **Description:** (optional, your current one is fine)
- **Public/Private:** Your choice (public is fine for open source)
- **Add a README file:** **Do NOT check**
- **Add .gitignore:** **None**
- **Choose a license:** **None** (unless you want to add one now)

---

**Next:**  
Click the green **Create repository** button.  
After that, GitHub will show you instructions to push your local code. If you need help with those steps, let me know!

**Cursor**

Great! Now that you’ve created the repository on GitHub, follow these steps to push your local project to the remote repository:

### 1. Add the remote repository
Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username if needed.

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MuviNight.git
```

### 2. Make your initial commit (if you haven’t already)
```sh
git commit -m "Initial commit: MuviNight movie recommendation system"
```

### 3. Push your code to GitHub
```sh
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

**Summary of commands to run:**
```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MuviNight.git
git commit -m "Initial commit: MuviNight movie recommendation system"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

If you already committed, you can skip the `git commit` step.  
If you want, I can run these commands for you—just let me know your GitHub username or paste the remote URL GitHub gave you!

```shellscript
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MuviNight.git
```

```shellscript
git commit -m "Initial commit: MuviNight movie recommendation system"
```

```shellscript
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

```shellscript
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MuviNight.git
git commit -m "Initial commit: MuviNight movie recommendation system"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Cursor**

The error `src refspec main does not match any` means that you haven't made an initial commit yet, so there is no `main` branch to push.

Let's make your initial commit and then push to GitHub:

1. **Stage all files (already done)**
2. **Commit your changes:**
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Initial commit: MuviNight movie recommendation system"
   ```
3. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Would you like me to run the commit command for you now?

```shellscript
   git commit -m "Initial commit: MuviNight movie recommendation system"
```

```shellscript
   git push -u origin main
```

The error `remote: Invalid username or password.` means that GitHub authentication failed. This is common if:

- You haven't set up a GitHub personal access token (PAT) for HTTPS pushes (GitHub no longer supports password authentication for git).
- Your credentials are not cached or are incorrect.

**How to fix:**

### 1. Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Go to your [GitHub settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
- Generate a new token with `repo` permissions.
- When prompted for a password during `git push`, use the token instead of your GitHub password.

### 2. (Recommended) Cache your credentials
You can use a credential helper to cache your token:
```sh
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

### 3. Push again
After setting up your token, run:
```sh
git push -u origin main
```
When prompted for your username, enter your GitHub username.  
When prompted for your password, paste your personal access token.

---

**If you want to use SSH instead:**
- Add your SSH key to GitHub and use the SSH remote URL.

---

If you need step-by-step help generating a token or setting up SSH, let me know!  
Once you authenticate successfully, your project will be published to GitHub: [MuviNight Repository](https://github.com/bedirhankaraahmetli/MuviNight.git).

git config --global credential.helper cache
```

```shellscript
git push -u origin main
```

**User**

what will i choose 

---

**Cursor**

To be able to **push** (write) to your GitHub repository from your local machine, you need to grant your personal access token (PAT) the correct permissions.

### What to choose:

#### 1. **Repository access**
- **Do NOT select only "Public repositories"** if it says "Read-only access to public repositories" (as in your screenshot).  
  This will NOT allow you to push (write) to your repository.
- **Select "All repositories"** or **"Only select repositories"** and make sure you grant **read and write** access, not just read-only.

#### 2. **Permissions**
- Scroll down to the **Repository permissions** section.
- Make sure you grant at least:
  - **Contents: Read and write** (this is required to push code)
  - You may also want to enable **Issues** and **Pull requests** if you plan to use those features.

#### 3. **Expiration**
- 30 days is fine for most use cases, but you can set a longer or shorter expiration as you prefer.

---

### **Summary of what to do:**
- **Repository access:**  
  - Choose **All repositories** (or "Only select repositories" and pick your MuviNight repo)
- **Permissions:**  
  - Under **Repository permissions**, set **Contents** to **Read and write**
- **Create token** and copy it somewhere safe (you will use it as your password when pushing).

---

**After creating the token:**
- When you run `git push`, use your GitHub username as the username, and paste the token as the password.

If you need a step-by-step for the next push, let me know!

From the permissions list you’ve shown, here’s what you need to do to be able to **push code** to your repository:

---

### **Minimum Required Permission**

- **Repository permissions → Contents:**  
  - Set this to **Read and write**  
  - This is the key permission that allows you to push (write) code to your repository.

---

### **How to set:**
1. Find the **Contents** section under "Repository permissions".
2. Change the dropdown from **Read-only** to **Read and write**.

---

You do **not** need to enable write access for all other permissions unless you specifically need them (for example, if you want to manage issues, pull requests, or workflows via the API). For most code pushes, **Contents: Read and write** is enough.

---

**After setting this, scroll down and click "Create token".  
Copy the token and use it as your password when you push with git.**

If you need to push now, just run:
```sh
git push -u origin main
```
and use your GitHub username and the new token as your password.

Let me know if you need help with the next step!

```shellscript
git push -u origin main
```

i get sshj

---

**Cursor**

If you are getting an SSH prompt (or error) when pushing, it means your Git remote is set to use SSH instead of HTTPS, or your Git is configured to prefer SSH.

### You have two options:

---

## **Option 1: Use HTTPS with Personal Access Token (Recommended for your case)**

1. **Set your remote to HTTPS:**
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/bedirhankaraahmetli/MuviNight.git
   ```

2. **Push again:**
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - When prompted, use your GitHub username and paste your personal access token as the password.

---

## **Option 2: Use SSH (if you have an SSH key set up with GitHub)**

1. **Set your remote to SSH:**
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:bedirhankaraahmetli/MuviNight.git
   ```

2. **Make sure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account.**
   - If you haven’t set up an SSH key, follow [GitHub’s SSH guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

3. **Push again:**
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**If you want to use your personal access token, use Option 1.**  
If you want to use SSH, make sure your SSH key is set up and use Option 2.

Let me know which method you prefer, and I can guide you step by step!

```shellscript
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/bedirhankaraahmetli/MuviNight.git
```

```shellscript
   git push -u origin main
```

```shellscript
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:bedirhankaraahmetli/MuviNight.git
```

```shellscript
   git push -u origin main
```

You are seeing this error because your file `dataset.csv` is **268.33 MB**, which exceeds GitHub's file size limit of **100 MB**. GitHub will not allow you to push files larger than 100 MB to your repository.

---

## How to Fix

### 1. **Remove the large file from your git history**
You need to remove `dataset.csv` from your repository and its history, then push again.

#### a. Remove the file and untrack it:
```sh
git rm --cached dataset.csv
echo "dataset.csv" >> .gitignore
```

#### b. Commit the change:
```sh
git commit -m "Remove large dataset.csv file and add to .gitignore"
```

#### c. Push again:
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 2. **If you need to store large files, use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)**
- Git LFS is designed for large files, but even then, GitHub's free tier has storage and bandwidth limits.
- For most projects, it's best to store large datasets elsewhere (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) and provide a download link in your README.

---

## **Summary**
- Remove `dataset.csv` from your repo and add it to `.gitignore`.
- Push your changes again.
- Store large files outside of GitHub and link to them if needed.

Let me know if you want me to run these commands for you!

```shellscript
git rm --cached dataset.csv
echo "dataset.csv" >> .gitignore
```

```shellscript
git commit -m "Remove large dataset.csv file and add to .gitignore"

git push -u origin main

```

The push is still being rejected because `dataset.csv` is present in your **git history** (previous commit), even though you removed it and added it to `.gitignore`. GitHub checks the entire history for large files.

To fix this, you need to **remove `dataset.csv` from your git history** using a tool like `git filter-repo` or `git filter-branch`.

---

## **Recommended Solution: Using `git filter-repo`**

### 1. Install `git-filter-repo` (if not already installed)
- On Windows, you can install it via pip:
  ```sh
  pip install git-filter-repo
  ```

### 2. Remove `dataset.csv` from your entire git history:
```sh
git filter-repo --path dataset.csv --invert-paths
```

### 3. Push to GitHub (force push required):
```sh
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

**This will permanently remove `dataset.csv` from your repository history and allow you to push to GitHub.**

Would you like me to run these commands for you, or do you want to proceed step by step?

```shellscript
  pip install git-filter-repo
```

```shellscript
git filter-repo --path dataset.csv --invert-paths
```

```shellscript
git push -u origin main --force
```

You received this message because `git filter-repo` is designed to prevent accidental data loss on repositories that are not fresh clones. It wants to make sure you really intend to rewrite history.

### **How to proceed:**

#### **Option 1: Use `--force` flag (if you are sure)**
If you are certain you want to rewrite the history of this repository (and you have no collaborators who would be affected), you can proceed with:

```sh
git filter-repo --force --path dataset.csv --invert-paths
```

#### **Option 2: Fresh Clone (safer for shared repos)**
If you want to be extra safe, you can:
1. Clone your repo to a new directory.
2. Run the filter-repo command there.
3. Push from the new clone.

---

### **What to do next:**
Since this is your local project and you want to clean the history, you can safely use the `--force` flag.

**Run:**
```sh
git filter-repo --force --path dataset.csv --invert-paths
```

Then, force push:
```sh
git push -u origin main --force
```

Let me know if you want to proceed and I can run these commands for you!

```shellscript
git filter-repo --force --path dataset.csv --invert-paths
```

```shellscript
git filter-repo --force --path dataset.csv --invert-paths
```

```shellscript
git push -u origin main --force
```

The error message:

```
fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

means that your remote named `origin` is either missing or was removed during the history rewrite.

---

## How to Fix

1. **Re-add the remote:**
```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/bedirhankaraahmetli/MuviNight.git
```

2. **Force push your cleaned history:**
```sh
git push -u origin main --force
```
